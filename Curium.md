Curium is a transuranic, radioactive chemical element with the symbol Cm and atomic number 96.

This actinide element was named after eminent scientists Marie and Pierre Curie, both known for their research on radioactivity.

Curium was first intentionally made by the team of Glenn T.

Seaborg, Ralph A.

James, and Albert Ghiorso in 1944, using the cyclotron at Berkeley.

They bombarded the newly discovered element plutonium with alpha particles.

This was then sent to the Metallurgical Laboratory at University of Chicago where a tiny sample of curium was eventually separated and identified.

The discovery was kept secret until after the end of World War II.

The news was released to the public in November 1947.

Most curium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains ~20 grams of curium.

Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a high melting and boiling point for an actinide.
