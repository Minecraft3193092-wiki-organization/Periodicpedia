Plutonium is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol Pu and atomic number 94.

It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized.

The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states.

It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen.

When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric.

It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.

Plutonium was first synthetically produced and isolated in late 1940 and early 1941, by a deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 1.5-metre cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley.

First, neptunium-238 was synthesized, which subsequently beta-decayed to form the new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 .
