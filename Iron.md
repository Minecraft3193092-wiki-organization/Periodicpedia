Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe and atomic number 26.

It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.

It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, just ahead of oxygen , forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.

It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state, with its ores also being found there.

Extracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 Â°C or higher, about 500 Â°C higher than that required to smelt copper.

Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BCE and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys-in some regions, only around 1200 BCE.

That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.
