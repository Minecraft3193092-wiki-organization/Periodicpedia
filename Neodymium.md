Neodymium is a chemical element with the symbol Nd and atomic number 60.

It is the fourth member of the lanthanide series and is considered to be one of the rare-earth metals.

It is a hard, slightly malleable, silvery metal that quickly tarnishes in air and moisture.

When oxidized, neodymium reacts quickly producing pink, purple/blue and yellow compounds in the +2, +3 and +4 oxidation states.

It is generally regarded as having one of the most complex spectra of the elements.

Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach, who also discovered praseodymium.

It is present in significant quantities in the minerals monazite and bastnäsite.

Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides, and it is usually refined for general use.

Neodymium is fairly common-about as common as cobalt, nickel, or copper-and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust.
