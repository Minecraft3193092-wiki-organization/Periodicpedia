Actinium is a chemical element with the symbol Ac and atomic number 89.

It was first isolated by Friedrich Oskar Giesel in 1902, who gave it the name emanium;

the element got its name by being wrongly identified with a substance André-Louis Debierne found in 1899 and called actinium.

Actinium gave the name to the actinide series, a set of 15 elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table.

Together with polonium, radium, and radon, actinium was one of the first non-primordial radioactive elements to be isolated.

A soft, silvery-white radioactive metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation.

As with most lanthanides and many actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds.
