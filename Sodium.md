Sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide.

Among many other useful sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide is used in soap manufacture, and sodium chloride is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.

Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants.

Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume.

Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia.

Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.

By means of the sodium-potassium pump, living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two potassium ions pumped in;
