Californium is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol Cf and atomic number 98.

The element was first synthesized in 1950 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , by bombarding curium with alpha particles .

It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the naked eye .

The element was named after the university and the U.S.

state of California.

Two crystalline forms exist for californium at normal pressure: one above and one below 900 °C .

A third form exists at high pressure.

Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature.

Californium compounds are dominated by the +3 oxidation state.

The most stable of californium's twenty known isotopes is californium-251, with a half-life of 898 years.

This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.
