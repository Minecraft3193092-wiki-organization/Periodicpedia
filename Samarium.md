Samarium is a chemical element with symbol Sm and atomic number 62.

It is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air.

Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually has the oxidation state +3.

Compounds of samarium are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium iodide.

Discovered in 1879 by French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, samarium was named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated.

The mineral itself was named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thus became the first person to have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly.

Samarium is the 40th most abundant element in Earth's crust and more common than metals such as tin.
