Magnesium is a chemical element with the symbol Mg and atomic number 12.

It is a shiny gray metal having a low density, low melting point and high chemical reactivity.

Like the other alkaline earth metals it occurs naturally only in combination with other elements and it almost always has an oxidation state of +2.

It reacts readily with air to form a thin passivation coating of magnesium oxide that inhibits further corrosion of the metal.

The free metal burns with a brilliant-white light.

The metal is obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine.

It is less dense than aluminium and is used primarily as a component in strong and lightweight alloys that contain aluminium.

In the cosmos, magnesium is produced in large, aging stars by the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus.

When such stars explode as supernovas, much of the magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium where it may recycle into new star systems.
