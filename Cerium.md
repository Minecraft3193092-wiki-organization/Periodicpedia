Cerium is a chemical element with the symbol Ce and atomic number 58.

Cerium is a soft, ductile, and silvery-white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air.

Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the oxidation state of +3 characteristic of the series, it also has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water.

It is also considered one of the rare-earth elements.

Cerium has no known biological role in humans but is not particularly toxic, except with intense or continued exposure.

Despite always occurring in combination with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as those of the monazite and bastnäsite groups, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state in aqueous solution.

It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium.
